A simple fabric mod for minecraft which causes players to place a blocks based on what they are looking at rather than a timer.

# Wyne10's note

The latest version of this mod on github is 1.14.2 and the latest version on curseforge is 1.19.3. Author made some updates but didn't upload them to github, so i had to update 1.14.2 version to 1.20. It looks like in this version you have to hold shift button to make mod work, so keep that in mind!
